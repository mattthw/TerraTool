# TerraTool
Learning the Spigot API

Goal is to create a basic long distance terraforming tool for a 3d voxel world (minecraft). There will be tools, which can be assigned a brush, which can be assigned a modifier. The user will be able to place, remove, and replace using various brush shapes. Modifiers will allow unique operations such as smoothing out a surface.
